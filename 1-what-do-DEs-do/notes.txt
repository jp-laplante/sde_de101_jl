What do Data Engineers do?

Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start?
How would you go about gathering requirements? 
Hint: Think backward from what the business may need. 
Share your assignment with me by creating a repo 
(like this one if you haven't already) and 
writing down your notes/code under the folder for lesson 1.

The first two things would be to schedule a meeting with the target stakeholders and begin
diving into the schemas/data models of the current architecture.  Understand what kind of analysis 
the stakeholders are striving for and see if the current data resides within the system.

If the current data is not within the current OLAP setup, then is that data available to our
extraction routines.  If not, meet with the developers to design a way to get the information
requested.

If the data is available - determine how to present it to the stakeholder.  Dashboards, 
timely reports, or just is just having the data available for them enough and they'll
design the reports.  Does the data only live in the OLTP and not in the OLAP?  If so, why?

Understand the timelines of the stakeholders:
    How soon do they want this analysis?
    How often is the analysis to be run?
    Refresh rate on the data (is it streaming or batch - how often is the batch run)
    For internal/external use?  Does PII or propietary data need to be scrubbed first?
